2. CDN for static assets
3. Lazy loading for images

### Code Quality

```go
func ProcessDocument(ctx context.Context, doc *Document) error {
    if err := validate(doc); err != nil {
        return fmt.Errorf("validation failed: %w", err)
    }
    return doc.Save(ctx)
}
```

## Next Steps

- [ ] Launch mobile application
- [x] Hire senior developer
- [x] Update documentation

## Conclusion

The project is on track for Q1 objectives. Team morale remains high and technical debt is under control.
